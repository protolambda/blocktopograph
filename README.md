## Get-started

Steps to get started quickly:

### Get-started: pre-installation

This project requires you to download some android SDKs, tools, libraries and drivers.

- SDKs + Tools: please check the sdk version before cloning a repo, then install sdk+tools for this version with SDK-manager.
- Libraries: You need to install the google-services and google-repository libraries with SDK-manager.
- Drivers: download the appropriate drivers for your phone to use `adb`.
    The SDK-manager provides windows drivers for the Nexus phones.
- Some libraries are downloaded by gradle itself. You do not have to worry about these.
- Sub-modules are managed with git. (See installation)


### Get-started: installation

NOTE: You may want to fork one of the dependencies (or this project) if you want to contribute.

1. `mkdir block-project` or something like that. This will be the main-container
1. `cd` into the new folder
1. `git clone` (your fork of) this repository
1. `git clone` (your fork of) [android-leveldb](https://github.com/protolambda/android-leveldb)
1. `cd android-leveldb` and `git submodule update` to get the
    [leveldb-mcpe](https://github.com/protolambda/leveldb-mcpe) git-submodule, it is required for building this project.
1. `cd ..` (back to the main container)
1. `git clone` (your fork of) [TileView](https://github.com/protolambda/TileView)
1. Add `local.properties` files to these projects,
    with `sdk.dir` for your sdk home,
    and with `ndk.dir` specified for `android-leveldb`.
1. Open the cloned blocktopograph repo with your IDE (android-studio and intellij-idea are tested).
    The blocktopograph repo should be the `root-module`;
     `app`, `library`(android-leveldb) and `tileview`(TileView) will be recognized as sub-modules.
1. Build the project with gradle
1. Make the project, to get android-leveldb native libs.
1. Switch build-variants of the projects you want to debug and rebuild with gradle (or leave them as is)
1. Good to go! Try running a debug build (`app` submodule)! Start with small-changes to see if you encounter any problems.


### Release-Workflow

The official Google-Play version is managed by @protolambda. The Release-signing keys are not available.
You can build it as debug build or sign it with your own keys.

This Google-Play version will be updated after any significant and well-written feature additions and fixes.

Issues and requests are welcome too, but please use the issue-tracker for this to keep things organized.
